# Corium ðŸ‘¾

Corium - is open source framework for Garry's Mod.

#### requires [gm_filesystem](https://github.com/gmodcorium/gm_filesystem)

Built on the following ideas:
* **Modularity**
* **Quickness of code execution** (optimization)
* Types of scripts are categorized into::
  * **Modules** - are files that add certain functionality that can be used later in your own scripts. Modules can be called mini-libraries.
  * **Plugins** - are mini-addons with which you can write whatever you want. That is, if you need to write a ball that bounces to the ceiling, you need to use plugins. Plugins use modules to connect all sorts of features.
  * **Packages** - are almost the same as modules, but they are installed and used differently. (**new**)

## Tips for development
* Use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as main editor.
  * Use [Better comments](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=aaron-bond.better-comments) extension
  * Use [Lua Language Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sumneko.lua) extension **/** Use [GLua Enhanced](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=venner.vscode-glua-enhanced) extension

```
# Later, if not lazy, methods and commands that can be used will be spelled out.
